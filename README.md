# ReactionSolver
Python program to solve chemical equations.

I made this beacuse I was sick and tired of solving reactions in bio. To use it, open up an interactive prompt and use native python operators (+, -, etc) along with the `solve()` function to return two `Molecule`s with matching amounts.
